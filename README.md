# lets-go-t3chfest

This repository has the material for the "Let's Go" Workshop for the T3echFest 2020.

We will use the Go Playground to run the exercises. In case there are internet issues, I recommend you to download the CheatSheet and the exercises prior to the session. You can also install the Go binary to run it in your computer (see details in the CheatSheet).

This is the list of playgrounds we will use during the session.

Hello Go: https://play.golang.org
